The innovation of the solar-powered portable oil extractor efficiently extracts oil from various seeds with minimal environmental impact. Key components of the extractor include efficient motors and pumps optimized for low power consumption, as well as lightweight and durable materials for portability and ease of transportation. Advanced filtration and extraction mechanisms ensure high-quality oil production while minimizing energy use.<br>

This compact device is user-friendly and produces clean oil suitable for food and medicinal purposes. Our implementation has achieved a 39.8% increase in efficiency using a 24V DC motor, successfully extracting 196 mL of mustard oil from 500 g of seeds in just 4.2 minutes. This performance is significantly better than traditional induction motors, which are slower and less efficient.
Additionally, smart controls and monitoring systems enable remote operation and real-time performance tracking, enhancing efficiency and user convenience. By leveraging cutting-edge engineering principles and renewable energy technologies, this solution addresses the growing demand for sustainable and portable oil extraction systems in remote or off-grid locations, empowering communities with access to essential resources while promoting environmental stewardship.

            A  graduate in Electrical and Electronics Engineering with one year of experiences (EEE) eager to embark on a fulfilling career in the renewable energy industry.
          </h2>
          <p class="justified">
            My name is Md. Abdullah Al Hossain, a 23-year-old graduate in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Independent University, Bangladesh, with a strong academic focus on Power Electronics and Renewable Energy Technologies. Currently, I am working as an Assistant Engineer at Esquire Electronics, where I am involved in designing control systems and developing energy-efficient solutions for home appliances. Over the past year, I’ve built practical experience through diverse roles. I spent 8 months working with SCADA systems, designing scalable, AI-integrated architectures for industrial automation. Prior to that, I served as a Research Assistant for 4 months, where I contributed to renewable energy projects, including the development of a solar-powered portable oil extractor—an initiative aimed at sustainable energy solutions. These roles have not only strengthened my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of real-world challenges in power systems and energy optimization. <br>

Raised in the serene surroundings of Sherpur, I developed a deep appreciation for nature, which later inspired my commitment to sustainability. Before pursuing my academic career, I volunteered with the Bangladesh Forest Division as an animal rescuer. That formative experience instilled in me a sense of purpose and reinforced my desire to contribute to the greater good through engineering and innovation.
<br>

Outside of my professional and academic life, I have a passion for sports and literature. I enjoy playing cricket, football, and volleyball, and I find creative expression through poetry and reading.
<br>

Looking ahead, I aspire to combine my technical expertise with a strong sense of environmental responsibility. I am driven to contribute to meaningful innovations in electronics and renewable energy that can positively impact both industry and society. Through curiosity, dedication, and purpose, I aim to be a catalyst for change in the world of sustainable technology.
